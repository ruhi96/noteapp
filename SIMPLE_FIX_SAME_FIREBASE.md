# Simple Fix: Use Same Firebase Project

## Current Situation

Your architecture is ALREADY set up correctly:

```
Web Client → Firebase (project X?) → Token → Render verifies → Supabase
Android Client → Firebase (noteapp-45c39) → Token → Render verifies → Supabase
```

Both clients share:
✅ Same Supabase database  
✅ Same Render backend  
✅ Same authentication flow  

## The Issue

They must use the **SAME Firebase project** or tokens won't verify.

## Solution (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Check if Already Using Same Project

1. Go to your web app: https://noteapp-moei.onrender.com
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run: `localStorage`
4. Look for Firebase entries - check project ID

**If it shows `noteapp-45c39`** → Great! Just need to add credentials to Render

**If it shows different project** → Need to use same project for both

### Option 2: Make Both Use noteapp-45c39

**Your Android already uses it**, so just ensure:

1. Web app also uses `noteapp-45c39`
2. Render has credentials from `noteapp-45c39`

## Verify Render Has Credentials

Since your web app works, check Render:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Environment variables
3. Look for:
   - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`

**If missing** → Web app wouldn't work (so they should be there)  
**If present** → Check if project ID matches `noteapp-45c39`

## Two Scenarios

### Scenario A: Web App Uses noteapp-45c39
- ✅ Android and Web use same project
- ✅ Render has credentials
- ❓ Why Android gets 401?
- **Fix**: Rebuild Android app after Render deployed

### Scenario B: Web App Uses Different Project
- ❌ Projects don't match
- **Fix**: Change Android to use web app's project OR vice versa

## Quick Test

**Test your web app now:**
1. Open: https://noteapp-moei.onrender.com
2. Try to sign in with Google
3. **If it works** → Render has Firebase credentials (just wrong project ID)
4. **If it fails** → Render needs Firebase credentials

## What's Your Status?

Please check:
1. Does web app sign-in work? (Yes/No)
2. What Firebase project does web app use? (check browser console)

Then I can give you the exact fix!
